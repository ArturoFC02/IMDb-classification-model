# IMDb-predictive-model

From the public database managed by IMDb (Internet Movie Database), the aim is to generate
a model capable of classifying in a binary way the different films existing in the database.
The classification categories will be given based on the average rating given by the public to
each of the films, differentiating between a “Successful Film” and an “Unsuccessful Film”. Where
the model, based on the inherent characteristics of each film (such as genre, country of origin,
language, etc.) and without knowing the average grade, you must assign them correctly in said categories.
